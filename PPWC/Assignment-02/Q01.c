/*
Using structured programming constructs, such as selection (e.g., if, switch) and repetition structures (e.g., for, while), offers several advantages over the goto statement:

Readability: Structured code is easier to read and understand, clearly defining program logic.

Maintainability: Well-structured code is simpler to modify and maintain compared to goto-based code.

Debugging: The predictable flow of control makes debugging easier.

Reduced Complexity: Structured programming avoids the tangled logic associated with goto, promoting a clearer flow.

Control Flow Clarity: Selection and repetition structures clearly express program intentions.

Scope Management: Variables have well-defined scopes, simplifying management of their lifetimes.

Error Handling: Structured constructs facilitate clearer error handling and recovery strategies.
