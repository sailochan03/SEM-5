/* 
>> If-Else Statements
-We can use it when we have complex conditions that cannot be easily evaluated with a single variable. 

>> Switch Statements
-We can use a switch statement when evaluating a single variable against multiple discrete values, especially when these values are constants (like integers or enums).
-Switch can enhance readability and organization compared to multiple if-else statements.
